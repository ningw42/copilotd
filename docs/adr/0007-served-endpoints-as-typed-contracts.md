# Model served endpoints as typed contracts with a facts-only boundary

**Status:** proposed

copilotd models each served operation as a single typed **Endpoint contract** in
the dependency-light `internal/endpoint` package. An Endpoint is an **inbound
binding paired with an upstream (outbound) dependency**: a route with an inbound
side but no outbound dependency (`/healthz`, `/readyz`) is answered locally and is
not an Endpoint. Each contract is one of four kinds — HTTP forward, WebSocket
forward, raw passthrough, or Catalog — and holds only declarative served facts:
the inbound pattern(s) it answers, the **Surface** (inbound API dialect) it
speaks, its upstream dependency, and its protocol rules. The `Surface` and `Route`
identity types live here too.

An Endpoint **owns its Surface**, so governance runs `Endpoint → Surface →
dialect-derived facts`. This gives a single rule for where a fact belongs: a fact
that can differ between two endpoints of the *same* Surface sits **directly on the
Endpoint** (whether an HTTP-forward endpoint may stream at all — `AllowsSSE`; the
upstream path; the inbound patterns); a fact uniform across a Surface is reached
**through the owned Surface** (the event that ends a stream, the error dialect).
*Directly on the Endpoint iff it varies within a Surface, otherwise on the
Surface* — that is how a future contributor decides where a new fact goes.

The boundary is the point of this decision. `internal/endpoint` answers *what is
served and with what facts*; it never answers *how the bytes are produced*. Pure
projections of those facts belong here (`Surface.String()`, `Endpoint.Patterns()`,
`HTTPForward.AllowsSSE()`); request handlers, HTTP clients, authentication,
rendering, and logging do not. Consumers (`server`, `forward`, `wsforward`,
`catalog`, `apierror`, metrics) depend on the contract, combine it with their own
implementation, and never re-derive the facts it already states. The package is a
leaf — standard library only, and nothing flows back into it.

The four kinds are an **open set**. Adding a served operation that fits an existing
kind is one new private facts record, parameterless accessor, and registration
line — no decision record needed. Adding a *new kind* — a genuinely different
outbound or protocol fact-shape — must amend this ADR (or a successor) to record
the kind, its distinct fact-shape, and why no existing kind fits, so the
taxonomy's growth stays auditable in one place.

## Considered options

- **Reconstruct the contract at each call site** (status quo): rejected — the
  Surface, upstream path, and streaming semantics were restated across `server`,
  `forward`, `shim`, `catalog`, `apierror`, and metrics, with two duplicated
  `Route` types and route constants kept in sync by hand. Invalid `(Surface,
  upstream)` pairs compiled, and streaming eligibility leaked from an upstream
  `Content-Type` header rather than from the route's contract.
- **One contract struct with a `Kind` enum and optional fields**: rejected — it
  reintroduces meaningless fields per kind (an SSE mode on a catalog, a required
  route on a forward) and invites the same "set the wrong field" errors the typed
  kinds prevent.
- **A generic handler registry that dispatches by contract**: rejected — it hides
  which handler serves which route behind a table and makes registration
  non-greppable. Registration stays an explicit line per endpoint.
- **Put rendering or handlers inside the endpoint package**: rejected — it would
  make the leaf package depend on the implementation packages it exists to serve,
  and would pull request-time and configuration concerns (for example, the Codex
  catalog shape) into a package meant to hold only static facts.
- **Seal kind interfaces with private methods**: rejected — embedding promotes
  the private method, so an external wrapper can override every public fact and
  still satisfy the interface accepted by a behavior factory.
- **Distinct typed contracts in a dependency-light package, facts only**
  (chosen): opaque concrete kinds preserve typed consumer boundaries. Each
  operation is one private package-level facts record; opaque handles can select
  only those records, every externally constructible zero value is canonical,
  and parameterless accessors expose the seven named contracts without mutable
  package variables. Consumers supply implementation at registration.

## Consequences

- Invalid `(Surface, upstream)` combinations are unconstructable: complete kinds
  are opaque concrete handles to package-defined facts records with canonical zero
  semantics. Consumers cannot construct arbitrary facts, mutate a named contract,
  or pass an embedding wrapper to a concrete factory parameter. The `Endpoint`
  interface exposed to registration contains only Surface/pattern projections and
  carries no upstream fact.
- Each served operation's binding, upstream dependency, and kind-specific protocol
  facts live together in one private package record, so adding an operation does
  not require synchronized switches.
- The duplicated `Route` types collapse to one `endpoint.Route`, and one route
  constant serves both a forward's upstream path and a catalog's required route.
  `/models` is one upstream path serving three Endpoints — the raw passthrough and
  the two catalogs — which makes the "same upstream, different served contracts"
  point concrete.
- The `Surface → string → index` metric round-trip collapses to a single
  `Surface.String()` projection, consumed by metrics, logs, and correlation alike.
- Streaming eligibility is a fact on the `HTTPForward` kind (`AllowsSSE`) — the one
  kind where it varies within a Surface — so a JSON-only route such as Anthropic
  Count Tokens can never be pumped as a stream by a mislabeled upstream response.
  This is the forward-path realization of ADR-0003.
- The placement rule binds future work: a new fact goes directly on the Endpoint
  only if it varies between endpoints of the same Surface; otherwise it belongs on
  the Surface (or its consumer).
- The boundary binds future work: a parity feature, a new render shape, or a new
  transport adds its behavior in a consumer and, at most, one contract instance —
  never handlers, clients, auth, or rendering inside `internal/endpoint`.
- The kind taxonomy is open but auditable: a new kind is allowed and must be
  recorded here, while a new instance of an existing kind needs no record.
- Request-conditional variants of one served operation (the Codex catalog shape on
  the OpenAI catalog) remain rendering branches of a single contract, not separate
  endpoints.
