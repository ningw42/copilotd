# Unify in-memory cached values into one component (and Codex `models.json` freshness)

**Status:** approved
**Date:** 2026-07-21

## Summary

copilotd holds several "small bits in memory" that are refreshed over the process
lifetime. Two of them share one shape — a value served from an **embedded
fallback**, refreshed best-effort from upstream, held **in memory only**:

- the two **impersonation version facts** (`internal/impersonation.versionFact`),
  discovered from public Microsoft endpoints on a 24h-by-default cadence; and
- the vendored **Codex `models.json`** snapshot (`internal/catalog`), today a
  static `go:embed` that goes stale relative to upstream `openai/codex`.

ADR-0008 deliberately left the refresh-with-fallback helper **concrete** inside
`internal/impersonation`, and named issue #53 (freshening the Codex snapshot) as
"the same shape but not a present consumer," making the extraction #53's
responsibility. This design does that extraction. It introduces a small generic
component — **`internal/cache`** — that owns freshness, concurrency, fallback,
observability, and readiness for one cached value, ports impersonation onto it
with no behavior change, and adds the Codex `models.json` freshness (#53) as a
second consumer.

The component is memory-only: nothing is written to disk, so the ROADMAP §2
state-at-rest principle (principle 4: "no services at rest … state at rest is a single owner-only
credential file") is honored exactly as it is for the impersonation
cache and the Copilot token. The Codex consumer tracks `openai/codex`'s **latest
release tag**, refreshes on a static TTL, and keeps the embedded snapshot as the
guaranteed-parseable floor. A `--codex-catalog-refresh-interval=0` disables the
outbound refresh for air-gapped or locked-egress deployments, mirroring
`--impersonation-refresh-interval=0`.

The Copilot token cache stays **out of scope** — it is a materially different
animal (see §Scope).

## Motivation

### Three in-memory caches, two of one shape

| Cache | Where | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copilot token | `identity/manager.go` | TTL from the exchange payload (`expires_at` + safety margin), `singleflight`-collapsed, minted **on demand in the request path** plus startup, **no fallback** (hard secret), tracks the mint outcome as readiness |
| Impersonation version facts (×2) | `impersonation/version_fact.go` | embedded **fallback** + fetched value, startup `Prime` (≤5s) + periodic `Run` (24h by default), **holds last-good** on failure, best-effort, non-secret observability snapshot |
| Codex `models.json` | `catalog/codex_snapshot.go` | today a static `go:embed` decoded once at init — #53's target |

The impersonation fact and the Codex snapshot are the same shape: *a vendored
value that rots, refreshed from upstream with an embedded fallback, held in
memory*. The Copilot token is not (see §Scope). This design unifies the two that
match and leaves the token alone.

### The memory win the Codex consumer gets for free

`models.json` is ~291 KB but only **8 models** — the bulk is each model's large
`base_instructions` prompt. The `catalog` package holds it **twice** today: the
`go:embed` bytes (in the binary's read-only data segment — demand-paged, shared,
effectively not heap) *and* the parsed `map[slug]map[field]RawMessage`, ~300 KB on
the heap held for the **entire process lifetime**, because the `RawMessage` values
copy the field bytes.

The freshened design does **not** retain a parsed form. The cache holds a cheap
version identity plus the raw bytes, and only when those bytes actually differ
from the embedded floor; the read path parses on demand. Steady-state heap for the
Codex catalog drops from ~300 KB held-forever to a few tens of bytes (the version
label), rising to ~291 KB only while a fetched release is genuinely ahead of the
floor. See §"The Codex `models.json` consumer".

### ADR-0008 anticipated this

ADR-0008 recorded the refresh-with-fallback helper as a concrete `versionFact`,
explicitly declining to pre-extract a generic primitive because there was one
present consumer and #53's runtime-vs-build-time question was unsettled. That
question is now settled — runtime, memory-only, latest-release-tag — so the
extraction is warranted and is exactly what #53 asked to own.

## Design

### `internal/cache`: one engine, N consumers

A new standard-library-only package. A consumer declares a **`Cacheable[V]`** —
the static recipe for one cached value — and receives a **`Value[V]`**, the live,
concurrency-safe object that runs it. A process-wide **`Registry`** aggregates the
operations that are genuinely collective (startup fan-out and observation);
everything type-specific stays on the per-entity `Value`.

#### `Cacheable[V]` — the recipe

```go
package cache

// Cacheable is the static, declarative recipe for one cached value. It does
// nothing on its own; a Value runs it. V is the served type — string for a
// version, []byte for a snapshot.
type Cacheable[V any] struct {
	// Fallback is the embedded floor, served until (and unless) a fetch succeeds.
	Fallback V
	// FallbackVersion identifies the floor, e.g. "rust-v0.144.5".
	FallbackVersion string
	// TTL is the refresh cadence. Static. TTL <= 0 disables refresh (air-gapped).
	TTL time.Duration

	// Version is the cheap, OPTIONAL peek: it fetches the latest version identity
	// without the full content, so an unchanged identity short-circuits the
	// download. It may be stale or coarse; it is a hint, never the contract. nil
	// means "no cheap peek — always Fetch, then compare by Hash".
	Version func(context.Context) (string, error)
	// Fetch retrieves the latest content and the version it corresponds to.
	Fetch func(context.Context) (value V, version string, err error)
	// Hash is the REQUIRED, AUTHORITATIVE content-identity contract: the engine
	// compares values ONLY by Hash to decide whether content actually changed. A
	// version bump whose Hash matches what is already served re-keys the label
	// without a validate/swap; a Hash that matches the Fallback drops back to
	// serving the floor and releases the fetched copy. Every consumer supplies one
	// (Codex hashes the models.json bytes; impersonation hashes the version string)
	// — there is no value-comparison path, so V never needs to be comparable and
	// there is no nil case: New panics on a nil Hash (or Fetch), a fail-fast wiring
	// check. Hash must be collision-resistant enough that distinct content never
	// collides — a cryptographic content hash suffices.
	Hash func(V) string
	// Validate is the accept-gate: it rejects a fetched value that does not meet
	// the consumer's contract (the required-field-drift gate). A rejected value
	// never enters the cache. nil means "accept any successful fetch".
	Validate func(V) error

	// Name is the stable key this value reports under in /readyz.
	Name string
}
```

#### `Value[V]` — the per-entity engine

`Value[V]` is the direct generalization of today's `versionFact`. It holds the
current value, its version, its hash, the freshness timestamps, and the mutexes,
and it runs the **refresh ladder**. The type-specific read, `Current`, lives here
because only the typed `Value` knows its `V`.

```go
func New[V any](src Cacheable[V], opts ...Option) *Value[V]

func (v *Value[V]) Current() (V, Status) // effective value (fetched, else fallback) + snapshot
func (v *Value[V]) Run(ctx context.Context) // its own refresh loop on its OWN TTL
```

`Value[V]` also satisfies an unexported `entry` interface — `prime`, `run`,
`observe` — through which the `Registry` drives it without knowing `V`. Consumers
keep the typed `*Value[V]` handle for `Current`; the `Registry` holds the erased
`entry`.

**The refresh ladder** (one `attempt`, run by `Prime` and by each `Run` tick) is
the two-level short-circuit that the version/hash split buys:

```
attempt(ctx):
  v := Version(ctx)                    // (1) cheap peek — identity only, no content
  if v == current.version:                          //     unchanged identity: no download at all
      recordAttempt(); return                       //     metadata success only; lastSuccess unchanged

  value, v := Fetch(ctx)               // (2) only now the full read
  h := Hash(value)                     // (3) authoritative content identity
  if h == current.hash:                              //     content identical across a version bump…
      setVersion(v); recordSuccess(); return         //     …re-key the label, no validate/swap
  if h == floor.hash:                                //     content equals the embedded floor…
      swapToFallback(v); recordSuccess(); return     //     …serve the embed, release the copy; source=fallback, last_success advances
  if err := Validate(value); err != nil:             //     accept-gate: never poison the cache
      holdLastGood(); recordFailure(err); return
  swap(value, v, h); recordSuccess()    // (4) new good value in
```

`recordAttempt` updates the internal attempt timestamp and clears the prior
attempt error. It deliberately does **not** advance `LastSuccess`: `Version` is
a potentially stale or coarse metadata hint, not a content fetch or validation.
`recordSuccess` records both the attempt and the successful content-fetch time;
a hash match is sufficient because that content identity was already accepted.

Semantics carried over verbatim from `versionFact` (ADR-0008):

- **Cold.** Until the first successful content fetch, `Current()` returns the
  fallback with `source == fallback` and nil `LastSuccess`. A successful
  version-only peek may avoid a download while the value remains cold by this
  content-freshness definition.
- **Warm failure.** After a prior success, a failed attempt keeps the
  **last-good** value; it records `lastAttempt`/`lastErr` and lets `lastSuccess`
  age. A transient blip never downgrades a known-good value.
- **`Run` does not fire at t=0.** The startup fetch is `Prime`'s job (below), so
  the ticker waits one TTL before its first tick — no double-fetch at boot.

`Run` owns its own `time.Ticker(src.TTL)`; there is **no shared ticker**. An
injected clock and an injectable ticker seam (as `versionFact` has today) keep the
loop and the aging logic deterministically testable.

```go
func (v *Value[V]) Run(ctx context.Context) {
	if v.src.TTL <= 0 { return }          // disabled (air-gapped)
	ticker := v.newTicker(v.src.TTL)      // its OWN TTL
	defer ticker.Stop()
	for {
		select {
		case <-ctx.Done():  return
		case <-ticker.C():  v.attempt(ctx)
		}
	}
}
```

#### `Registry` — the aggregate

The `Registry` holds every registered `entry` and owns exactly the two
operations that are collective, plus a launcher for the per-entity loops:

```go
type Registry struct { /* []entry, guarded */ }

func (r *Registry) Register(e entry)          // impersonation and catalog register their Values

func (r *Registry) Prime(ctx context.Context) // fan-out the bounded startup fetch across all entries
func (r *Registry) Start(ctx context.Context) // launch each entry's own Run(ctx) goroutine (per-TTL)
func (r *Registry) Observe() []Status         // collect the snapshot of every entry that publishes one
```

- `Prime` runs every entry's startup attempt **concurrently**, bounded by one
  overall deadline (5s), and returns when all settle or the deadline fires — the
  generalization of `Set.Prime`. A miss leaves that entry on its fallback.
- `Start` is a **thin launcher**, not a shared loop: it ranges the entries and
  starts each one's `Run(ctx)`. TTLs stay per-entity. It exists only so `main`
  has one call site instead of N.
- `Observe` collects each entry's `Status`; an entry may decline to publish (the
  bool below), so a value with nothing useful to show adds no `/readyz` noise.

`Status` is the type-erased, **non-secret** freshness record:

```go
type Status struct {
	Name        string     // "vscode", "copilot_chat", "codex_models"
	Source      string     // provenance of the value served NOW: "fetched" (a distinct fetched value) | "fallback" (the embedded floor)
	Version     string     // effective version label, e.g. "rust-v0.145.0" or "1.129.1"
	LastSuccess *time.Time // last successful content fetch; a version-only peek does not advance it
}

// entry is the unexported, type-erased view the Registry drives.
type entry interface {
	prime(context.Context) error
	run(context.Context)
	observe() (Status, bool) // bool == "publish me in /readyz"
}
```

This is precisely the split settled during design: `Current`/`Run` are inherently
per-entity (one is typed, one is a per-TTL loop); `Prime`/`Observe` are aggregates
the `Registry` folds over the per-entity `prime`/`observe`. Readiness stays purely
local-prerequisite (ADR-0008); no cached value gates `/readyz`.

`Source` and `LastSuccess` are **independent**. `Source` names the provenance of
the value served *now*: `"fetched"` when a distinct fetched value is served,
`"fallback"` whenever the embedded floor is served — which includes a successful
fetch that proved byte-identical to the floor (the floor-revert releases the
fetched copy for the memory win, so the served bytes are the embed). `LastSuccess`
names when upstream last supplied content whose identity was accepted by the
hash/validate ladder. It advances on **every** successful content fetch,
including hash-equal and floor-identical content, and is nil until the first such
fetch. A version-only peek records an attempt but leaves `LastSuccess` unchanged
because `Version` is only a metadata hint. A cold cache (`source: "fallback"`, nil
`LastSuccess`) is thus distinguishable from one whose fetched content was
confirmed current-to-floor (`source: "fallback"`, non-nil `LastSuccess`); an
unchanged-version short-circuit remains in the former state.

### Consumer: `internal/impersonation` (behavior-equivalent port)

`versionFact` is deleted. `Set` keeps its two facts as `*cache.Value[string]` and
its domain composition (`Header()` assembling two versions into five headers) —
that stays in `impersonation`, since it is not generic. `Set.Prime`/`Set.Run`/
`Set.Observe` are removed; the `Registry` drives lifecycle and observation.

```go
func New(cfg Config, edge Edge, reg *cache.Registry, logger *slog.Logger) *Set {
	s := &Set{
		vscode: cache.New(cache.Cacheable[string]{
			Name: "vscode", FallbackVersion: cfg.VSCodeVersionFallback,
			Fallback: cfg.VSCodeVersionFallback, TTL: cfg.RefreshInterval,
			Fetch: func(ctx context.Context) (string, string, error) {
				v, err := edge.discoverVSCode(ctx); return v, v, err
			},
			Hash:     hashVersion, // required content hash of the version string
			Validate: validateVersion, // the version accept-gate, relocated from discovery.go
			// Version nil: the fetch is tiny, so peek == fetch (no cheap peek to add).
		}, cache.WithLogger(logger)),
		plugin: /* … copilot_chat, same shape … */,
		integrationID: cfg.CopilotIntegrationID, apiVersion: cfg.GithubAPIVersion,
	}
	reg.Register(s.vscode); reg.Register(s.plugin)
	return s
}

func (s *Set) Header() http.Header { // unchanged: reads Current() of each fact, derives 5 headers
	v, _ := s.vscode.Current(); c, _ := s.plugin.Current()
	return s.header(v, c)
}
```

For impersonation, `Version` is `nil` (the fetch is a tiny payload, so there is no
cheap peek to add), while `Hash` is a content hash of the version string — supplied
like every consumer's, since the engine has no value-comparison path. The degenerate
`Version` cell falls out of the same engine at no cost — the codex-specific peek does
not burden impersonation. Validation relocates: `discoverVSCode`/`discoverCopilotChat`
keep their *selection* logic (skip prereleases, take the first stable candidate /
`releases[0]`) but no longer call `validateVersion` themselves; the cache's
`Validate` cell is now the single accept-gate, unifying with Codex's
`decodeCodexModels`. Behavior is equivalent at the boundary to ADR-0008 — a value
that fails the gate is held back as last-good/fallback exactly as before; only
`source` renders as `"fetched"` rather than `"discovered"` (see §Observability).

### The Codex `models.json` consumer (#53)

A single `*cache.Value[[]byte]`, wired in `internal/catalog`:

| `Cacheable[[]byte]` field | Codex value |
| --- | --- |
| `Fallback` | the `go:embed` snapshot bytes (the guaranteed-parseable floor) |
| `FallbackVersion` | the vendored tag, `rust-v0.144.5` |
| `TTL` | `--codex-catalog-refresh-interval` (default 24h; `0` disables) |
| `Version` | `GET /repos/openai/codex/releases/latest` → the release **tag** (cheap; no blob) |
| `Fetch` | GET `models.json` at that tag → `([]byte, tag, err)` |
| `Hash` | content hash of the bytes |
| `Validate` | `decodeCodexModels` parses cleanly — **the required-field-drift gate** |
| `Name` | `codex_models` |

**Latest release tag as the version identity.** The tracked ref is
`openai/codex`'s newest release tag (the `rust-vX.Y.Z` lineage the vendored
snapshot is already pinned to). A tag is immutable and pins a commit, which
satisfies #53's "commit-based" intent while giving the peek a cheap, human-readable
compare. The ladder for Codex:

1. **Peek** `releases/latest` → tag. Tag unchanged → touch, done (no 291 KB
   download). Most ticks stop here.
2. **Fetch** `models.json` at the tag. Compute its content hash.
3. **Hash unchanged** vs the served value (a release that didn't touch
   `models.json`) → re-key the version label to the new tag, no validate/swap.
4. **Hash matches the embedded floor** (a release whose `models.json` equals the
   vendored snapshot) → serve the floor and release any fetched copy, so we never
   hold 291 KB byte-identical to the embed we already have for free.
5. **Validate** with `decodeCodexModels`; a blob that does not parse into the
   expected `ModelInfo` shape is **rejected** — we hold last-good (or the floor)
   and log. This is the drift protection #53 calls out: a newer `models.json` that
   our renderer can't honor never displaces a good value.
6. **Swap** the bytes + tag + hash in.

**Parse on the read path; validate on accept.** The package-level
`var codexModels = mustDecodeCodexModels(...)` is removed. The catalog render path
calls `decodeCodexModels(value)` on `Current()` at request time. The Codex catalog
`/models` path is cold — clients fetch the list rarely, and Codex caches it 300s
client-side — so re-parsing 8 models per read is negligible. The **only** retained
copy is the raw bytes, and only while a fetched release is ahead of the floor; when
`Current()` returns the embed (the common case), no extra bytes are held. Parsing
still happens once at **accept** time (step 4) to validate, but that parse is
discarded, not retained.

The embedded snapshot, its `LICENSE`/`NOTICE`/`PROVENANCE`, and the `decodeCodexModels`
validator are unchanged; the snapshot's role shifts from "the served value" to
"the floor and the accept-time contract."

### Startup and refresh lifecycle

`main` builds one `Registry`, wires both consumers into it, and drives it around
the existing startup mint — the generalization of today's impersonation block:

```go
reg := cache.NewRegistry()
imp := impersonation.New(impCfg, edge, reg, logger) // registers its 2 facts
if codexCfg.Enabled {                               // gated: no outbound when the catalog is off
	catalog.NewModelsCache(codexCfg, reg, logger)   // registers codex_models
}

go func() {
	reg.Prime(serveCtx)        // all entries' startup fetch, concurrent, ≤5s overall
	reg.Start(serveCtx)        // launch each entry's own per-TTL Run loop
	mgr.StartupMint(serveCtx)  // first mint carries fresh impersonation headers
}()
```

`Prime` is a **wait, not a gate**: a slow or failed startup fetch leaves that entry
on its fallback and startup proceeds. Neither a fetch outcome nor the mint gates
`/readyz` — readiness is purely local (ADR-0008). The listener is bound before this
runs, so `/healthz` and a locally-ready `/readyz` serve throughout. A Codex prime
that misses the 5s bound (or fails outright) simply holds the embedded floor until
the first `Run` tick one TTL later; because the floor is the guaranteed-parseable
snapshot, this is never worse than shipping today's static embed. On `serveCtx`
cancellation at shutdown, `Prime` returns early and every `Run` exits cleanly.

**Disabling refresh.** `TTL <= 0` makes `Value.Run` a no-op and `Prime` skip that
entry's outbound fetch, pinning it to the fallback for the process lifetime — the
air-gapped / locked-egress mode, per consumer. `--impersonation-refresh-interval=0`
and `--codex-catalog-refresh-interval=0` are independent. For Codex there are two
independent opt-outs: `--codex-catalog-enabled=false` skips registration entirely
(no entry, no outbound, no `/readyz` row), while `--codex-catalog-refresh-interval=0`
keeps the entry but pins it to the embedded floor.

### Configuration

One new flag, following the `--codex-catalog-*` family and the
`--impersonation-refresh-interval` precedent:

| Flag / env | Default | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--codex-catalog-refresh-interval` / `COPILOTD_CODEX_CATALOG_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | `24h` | Codex `models.json` refresh cadence; must be `>= 0`. `0` disables the outbound refresh (pins to the embedded snapshot). |

`ServeConfig` gains `CodexCatalogRefreshInterval`; the startup config log lists it
beside the existing `codex-catalog-*` fields. `--codex-catalog-enabled=false` skips
the freshness cache entirely: it is registered only when the Codex catalog is
served, so a disabled catalog makes no outbound `openai/codex` request and shows no
`codex_models` entry on `/readyz`. `--codex-auto-review-model`,
`--codex-auto-review-model-overrides`, and `--codex-catalog-override-limits` are
unaffected; the freshness cache sits underneath them and is inert whenever the Codex
catalog is not served.

### Observability (`/readyz`)

`/readyz` stays unauthenticated and keeps its coarse `status` bit. The per-fact
freshness that ADR-0008 nested under `impersonation.discovery` moves into a uniform
`caches` view fed by `Registry.Observe()`, so every cached value — impersonation
and Codex alike — reports the same non-secret shape. Impersonation's
domain-specific `effective_headers` composition stays under an `impersonation`
block, rendered by `server` from `Set.Header()` (it is not a generic freshness
fact, so it does not belong in the `caches` view).

```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "caches": {
    "vscode":       { "source": "fetched",  "version": "1.129.1",        "last_success": "2026-07-21T12:00:00Z" },
    "copilot_chat": { "source": "fallback", "version": "0.26.7",         "last_success": null },
    "codex_models": { "source": "fetched",  "version": "rust-v0.145.0",  "last_success": "2026-07-21T11:00:00Z" }
  },
  "impersonation": {
    "effective_headers": {
      "Editor-Version": "vscode/1.129.1",
      "Editor-Plugin-Version": "copilot-chat/0.26.7",
      "User-Agent": "GitHubCopilotChat/0.26.7",
      "Copilot-Integration-Id": "vscode-chat",
      "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2025-04-01"
    }
  }
}
```

Only non-secret state appears: each cache's `source`, effective `version`, and
`last_success`, plus the already-non-secret effective headers. `source` and
`last_success` are independent (see §`Status`): `source` names the provenance of the
value served now (`"fetched"` = a distinct fetched value; `"fallback"` = the embedded
floor, which includes a fetch proved byte-identical to the floor), while
`last_success` advances on every successful content fetch whose identity passes
the hash/validate ladder. A version-only peek records an attempt but leaves it
unchanged, so it is null until the first content fetch succeeds. A cold cache
(`source: "fallback"`, null `last_success`) is distinguishable from one whose
fetched content was confirmed current-to-floor (`source: "fallback"`, non-null
`last_success`); an unchanged-version short-circuit remains cold by this
content-freshness definition. No token and no raw fetch-error text are exposed: a
cache with no successful content fetch has null `last_success`, while a failure
after success leaves an aging value. `HEAD` still writes no body. When a
consumer's refresh is disabled (`TTL == 0`), its entry still renders with
`source: "fallback"` and null `last_success` because it never fetches content.

This is a deliberate, backward-compatible-on-`status` evolution of ADR-0008's
`/readyz` shape (the per-fact freshness relocates; `effective_headers` is retained;
`source` reads `"fetched"`, not `"discovered"`). It is a task in the extraction
sub-issue, not a silent side effect.

### Error handling and resilience

- Each fetch is individually bounded **by its consumer edge**: impersonation's
  `discoverVSCode`/`discoverCopilotChat` wrap a 5s `discoveryTimeout`, and the Codex
  peek and blob read wrap a 5s per-call timeout too, so a hung upstream stalls neither
  that consumer's refresh loop nor any other consumer. The HTTP clients stay
  timeout-less by repo convention (the caller owns the context, as `newExchangeClient`
  / `newDiscoveryClient` already do). `Prime` additionally caps the combined startup
  wait across all entries at 5s.
- Failures never touch readiness (for the current `false` consumers) and never
  overwrite a good value — cold failures hold the fallback, warm failures hold the
  last-good.
- A malformed / unparseable fetch (impersonation shape-check, Codex
  `decodeCodexModels`) is a failure, not a poison-write — the accept-gate rejects
  it before the swap.
- Every `Run` stops on context cancellation at shutdown; `Prime` returns early on
  cancellation and skips entries whose `TTL <= 0` (no outbound).
- Logging: the engine logs each refresh success at debug and each refresh failure at
  warn (naturally rate-limited by the TTL cadence); `main`'s startup sequence logs the
  startup outcome at info.

## Scope

**The Copilot token Manager stays a separate component.** The `Cacheable[V]` lens
proves the mismatch: the token has **no static TTL** (its lifetime comes from the
exchange payload's `expires_at`), **no fallback** (it is a hard secret — an expired
token cannot be "held last-good"), and **no version/hash**. Four of the six
properties do not apply. It also mints **on demand in the request hot path** under
`singleflight`, and its success is what a request needs rather than anything the
cache engine models — a cached value never gates readiness at all. Folding it in
would either bloat the generic engine or strip the token's carefully tuned
behavior. It remains in `internal/identity`, unchanged.

**The provider-shaped Catalog is not a cache** and is untouched: it fetches
Copilot's `/models` fresh on every request (`catalog/handler.go`), holding nothing.

## Testing

Test-first, matching the package layout:

- **`cache.Value`** — injected `Fetch`/`Version`/`Hash`/`Validate` and a fake
  clock and ticker: cold serves fallback (`source: fallback`, nil `last_success`); a
  validated fetch whose hash differs from the floor swaps to `source: fetched`; a
  floor-identical fetch stays `source: fallback` but advances `last_success`; warm
  failure holds last-good and ages `last_success`; the ladder skips the download when
  `Version` is unchanged while recording the attempt without advancing
  `last_success`, skips validate/swap when `Hash` matches the served value, drops
  back to the floor when `Hash` matches the fallback, and rejects (holds last-good)
  when `Validate` fails; `Current()` is race-clean under `-race`;
  `TTL <= 0` makes `Run` a no-op; `New` panics on a nil `Hash`/`Fetch`.
- **`cache.Registry`** — `Prime` fans out concurrently and honors the 5s bound;
  `Start` launches one loop per entry on its own TTL; `Observe` collects only
  publishing entries.
- **impersonation port** — assembler correctness across all four fallback/fetched
  states → exact fallback strings; the two facts register and drive through the
  `Registry`; `Header()` reflects a mid-flight swap on the next call; validation
  now lives in the `Validate` cell, so the discovery functions no longer reject an
  invalid version themselves — a value failing the gate holds last-good/fallback
  as before; existing `httptest` discovery tests are updated for that relocation.
- **Codex `models.json` consumer** — `httptest` GitHub edge: peek returns an
  unchanged tag → no blob fetched; a new tag with identical content → re-key, no
  re-validate; a new tag whose content equals the embedded floor → serve the
  floor, hold no fetched copy; a new tag with a good blob → swap; a new tag with a
  blob that fails `decodeCodexModels` → rejected, floor/last-good retained; the
  render path parses `Current()` and never a package-level global; disabled TTL
  never calls the edge; a disabled catalog (`--codex-catalog-enabled=false`)
  registers nothing and never calls the edge.
- **`identity.Manager`** — unchanged; still reads impersonation through the
  `Impersonation` interface.
- **`server` `/readyz`** — the `caches` block carries every registered entry; a
  cold or disabled entry renders `source: "fallback"` / null `last_success`, while a
  floor-identical confirmation renders `source: "fallback"` with non-null
  `last_success`; the `impersonation.effective_headers` block is retained; `HEAD`
  writes nothing.
- **e2e `serve`** — inject stub GitHub / Microsoft base URLs (the existing
  injected-base-URL pattern) and assert the Codex catalog serves fetched entries
  when ahead of the floor and that `/readyz` reports every cache.

## Considered alternatives

- **Build-time CI re-vendoring instead of a runtime cache**: rejected for this
  epic — it keeps a static embed with zero runtime dependency, but then there is
  no in-memory cache to unify and #53 becomes a CI-automation issue. The chosen
  runtime/memory-only path both freshens Codex *and* is the thing worth unifying.
  (CI bumping the embedded **floor** periodically remains compatible and orthogonal.)
- **Track the default branch head (or arbitrary latest commit)**: rejected — it
  pulls unreleased, in-progress prompt edits the moment they land, on a path where
  our fetched entries become a model's live values (no field-level merge upstream).
  The latest **release tag** advances only at reviewed release boundaries.
- **Retain the parsed `map` in the cache** (parse-on-accept, keep the result):
  rejected — it reinstates the ~300 KB held-forever the redesign removes, for a
  cold read path that re-parses 8 models trivially. The cache holds bytes +
  provenance; the read path owns parsing.
- **Fold the Copilot token into the component**: rejected — see §Scope; four of
  the six `Cacheable` properties do not apply, and unifying would degrade the token's
  hot-path minting.
- **Persist the cache to a file**: rejected — durable state at rest violates
  ROADMAP §2 (principle 4) and the token/impersonation in-memory model. The component is
  memory-only.
- **`Run` on the `Registry` as a single shared loop**: rejected — TTLs are
  per-entity, so the loop is per-entity. The `Registry` only offers `Start`, a
  launcher that fans out to each entry's own ticker.

## Consequences

- One tested freshness/concurrency/fallback/observability/readiness engine backs
  two (soon: any number of) cached values. `versionFact` is deleted; impersonation
  behavior is unchanged.
- The Codex catalog stops going stale silently: it tracks `openai/codex`'s latest
  release tag and refreshes on a TTL, with the embedded snapshot as a
  never-worse-than-today floor and drift-safe accept-gating.
- Steady-state heap for the Codex catalog drops from ~300 KB held-forever to a few
  tens of bytes (or ~291 KB only while ahead of the floor); parsing moves to the
  cold read path.
- **One new outbound dependency** on a Copilot-only-otherwise path: unauthenticated
  `api.github.com` release/`raw` reads for `openai/codex`, hit at startup and every
  24h by default. The fetch is deliberately **unauthenticated** — copilotd does not reuse its
  in-memory GitHub OAuth token on this path, keeping the Codex-freshness dependency
  credential-isolated. It carries no credentials and is not the Copilot exchange or
  inference endpoint, so it adds none of the idle-exchange abuse signal ADR-0001
  avoided. `--codex-catalog-enabled=false` (no registration) or
  `--codex-catalog-refresh-interval=0` (pinned to the floor) opts out entirely.
- This introduces a **runtime cache of external content**. It is **consistent with**
  the ROADMAP's state-at-rest principle (§2, principle 4 — "no services at rest … state at rest is a
  single owner-only credential file"), not an exception to it: the cache is
  **memory-only** (nothing at rest) with an embedded floor, exactly as the impersonation
  cache and the Copilot token already are. The considered interpretation — that a
  memory-only, best-effort refresh with an embedded floor honors "no state at rest" — is
  recorded as **ADR-0009** and noted in the ROADMAP.
- `/readyz` gains a uniform `caches` block and relocates impersonation's per-fact
  freshness into it; `status` is unchanged and backward-compatible.

## Epic decomposition

This design anchors an `epic` (tracked as **#92**). As delivered it is decomposed into
**three** native sub-issues — a refinement of the two conceptual items below: the first
item (extract `internal/cache`; port impersonation) was split into an engine ticket and
a port ticket so each fits a single implementation context. The native chain is
**#93 → #94 → #95**.

1. **Extract `internal/cache`; port impersonation** — delivered as two tickets:
   - **#93 — build the engine.** Introduce `Cacheable[V]`, `*Value[V]`, `Registry`,
     `Status`, and the refresh ladder (engine + tests only, no consumers).
     *Can start immediately.*
   - **#94 — port impersonation.** Port the two impersonation facts onto the engine
     (relocating version validation into the `Validate` accept-gate —
     behavior-equivalent at the boundary, the existing discovery wire contract and its
     tests preserved); relocate `/readyz` freshness into the `caches` block; ratify the
     `CONTEXT.md` glossary terms and the `refresh` disambiguation (canonized with this
     design). *Blocked by #93.*
2. **#95 — Codex `models.json` freshness as a `cache` consumer.** Add the
   `*cache.Value[[]byte]` (registered only when `--codex-catalog-enabled`),
   latest-release-tag tracking, the version/hash ladder with floor-revert, the
   `decodeCodexModels` accept-gate, parse-on-read (remove the package-level parsed
   global), the unauthenticated `openai/codex` fetch (5s per-call bound),
   `--codex-catalog-refresh-interval`, and the `codex_models` `/readyz` entry;
   author **ADR-0009** and update `CONFIGURATION.md` and the ROADMAP. *Blocked by #94.*

Issue **#53** (the original "commit-based caching/refresh for the vendored Codex
`models.json` snapshot") is superseded by this epic and closed as not-planned; its
scope lives in #95.

## Glossary additions (`CONTEXT.md`)

New canonical terms, canonized in `CONTEXT.md` with this design:

- **Cached value** — an in-memory value served from an embedded **fallback** and
  refreshed best-effort from upstream on a static TTL, holding last-good on
  failure; never persisted. The impersonation version facts and the Codex
  `models.json` snapshot are cached values. *Avoid*: cache (unqualified), which is
  also used loosely for the Copilot token.
- **Refresh ladder** — the version → hash → validate short-circuit a cached value
  runs on each attempt: an unchanged **version** skips the download; a content
  **hash** equal to the served value skips validate/swap (equal to the embedded
  floor drops back to serving it); a failed **validate** (the accept-gate) rejects
  the fetch and holds last-good.
- **Cache registry** — the process-wide aggregate that primes, launches, and
  observes all cached values.

**refresh** is disambiguated, not globally reserved: as the *token-mint verb* it
stays avoided (use **mint**); as the *cadence and mechanism of re-fetching a cached
value* it is the sanctioned term (`--*-refresh-interval`, the **refresh ladder**).
The engine's Go method names still prefer `attempt`/`fetch`, but the domain word
for what a cached value does is *refresh*. **discovery** stays impersonation's
edge-specific term for its Microsoft-endpoint fetch.

## ADR

The runtime-cache decision (memory-only, embedded floor, latest-release-tag,
unauthenticated/credential-isolated outbound `openai/codex` dependency,
disable-able) is recorded as **ADR-0009**, authored in sub-issue (2). ADR-0008
remains the record for the impersonation discovery decision; this design fulfils
its deferred extraction.
